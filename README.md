# BlockFacebookEmojis
Google Chrome Extension that blocks emoji reactions and shows likes to a Facebook post in traditional way. 

#Installation 
1. Install [BlockFacebookEmojis](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-facebook-emojis/fdjmekhlldbcpkcbafabmnbfedhdmckj) from the Chrome Web Store. 
2. Clone the repository and install it in the Google Chrome browser manually from the "Extensions" tab.

#Usage 
This extension works automatically on all Facebook pages. A small time gap with visible emojis  is possible because I couldn't find a way to hide emojis after adding to DOM but before rendering. If you have any ideas feel free to make a pull request.
